SETUP:
Clone the git repository to any one of OSU's flip servers.
Run the following commands to install the necessary depenencies:
pip3 install --user virtualenv
python3 -m venv
source ./bin/activate
pip3 install flask-mysqldb
pip3 install gunicorn

RUNNING:
After initial setup, run the following commands before testing any website changes:
source ./venv/bin/activate
^this initiates the virtual environment where we've set up our modules

gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:802x -D app:app
^this starts the server, if it isn't already running. Change the final x to any number aside from
"1" for development, and change the final x to "1" for deployment


CLOSING:
If you want to kill an active server (so you can restart it), first run the following command:
ps ax | grep gunicorn
^Then find your specific instance of the server. Find the 4/5-digit number that precedes your
specific gunicorn instance. It will look like /nfs/stak/users/YOURONID/whateverelse

Then run the following command to kill the server:
kill -p xxxxx
^Where xxxxx is the number you found for your process
